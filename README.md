# My First Plugin EVER!
As a newbie, i'm trying to learn new things in pocketmine. Like this plugin

# Message Config
This is nice. You can now Config your message in config.yml in plugindata!

For now, we are having problem in config. When you look the config in plugindata, it's empty. Paste this in config.yml:
```
title-hub: "Teleported To Hub"

sub-hub: "Teleported!"

message-hub: "Teleported"
```
