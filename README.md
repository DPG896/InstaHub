# Message Config
This is nice. You can now Config your message in config.yml in plugindata!

For now, we are having problem in config. When you look the config in plugindata, it's empty. Paste this in config.yml:
```
title-hub: "Teleported To Hub"

sub-hub: "Teleported!"

message-hub: "Teleported"
```
